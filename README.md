# **CScript** 

**A modern systems language with a C soul and a Rust mind, built for a new era of development.**

CScript is a new, from-scratch compiler for a systems programming language that combines the low-level control of C with the modern syntax and safety features inspired by Rust. It's designed for developers who love C's simplicity and performance but crave a more expressive, less error-prone development experience.

This project is built in Rust, leveraging a world-class toolchain to achieve an industrial-grade standard:

  * **Lexical Analysis**: `logos`
  * **Syntactic Analysis**: `chumsky`
  * **Semantic Analysis**: Hand-written Visitor Pattern
  * **Code Generation**: `inkwell` (LLVM)
  * **Error Reporting**: `ariadne`

## ‚ú® **Why CScript?**

CScript isn't just another C dialect. It's a reimagining of what C could be, guided by a few core principles:

### **üß† Context-Driven Type Ascription**

In CScript, we draw a strict distinction between "literals" and "typed values." A literal, such as `10` or `3.14`, is itself **"typeless."** It is merely a representation of a potential value and carries no specific type information until it is used.

The type is bestowed at the moment of "ascription." In the statement `x: u8 = 10;`, the `: u8` is not a simple "annotation" or a form of "type inference." Instead, it is the core action of **Type Ascription**. It takes the typeless integer literal `10` and **confirms and initializes** it as a concrete value of type `u8`.

This process ensures that every value has a clear, unambiguous type from the very start of its life. We call this philosophy **"Type Annotation is Initialization."** This design not only enables precise compile-time checks (e.g., whether `10` overflows `u8`) but also fundamentally eliminates the need for verbose casting syntax.

### **üíñ Developer-First Diagnostics**

Clear, precise error messages are not an afterthought. Powered by `ariadne`, our diagnostic system points you exactly to the problem, making debugging faster and more intuitive.

### **üõ†Ô∏è Modern, Unambiguous Syntax**

We use a `name: type` declaration style inspired by modern languages. This eliminates classic C ambiguities (like the [most vexing parse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_vexing_parse)) and makes the code cleaner and easier to read.

## üìö **Features at a Glance**

  * **Rich Type System**: `i8`-`i64`, `u8`-`u64`, `f32`/`f64`, `bool`, `char`, and pointers.
  * **Modern Structs**: Define complex data types with a clean, Rust-style syntax and instantiate them with C-style aggregate literals.
  * **Memory Safety (Compile-Time)**: Overflow checking for all numeric literals based on their context.
  * **Advanced Control Flow**: `if/else`, `while`, `return`, `break`, `continue`, and nested block scopes.
  * **LLVM Backend**: JIT compilation to high-performance, native executables.
  * **Complete Toolchain**: From source code to executable, the entire pipeline is robust and tested.

## üöÄ **A Quick Tour**

Let's see what CScript can do. Here's an example showcasing structs, functions, and modern syntax. Save this as `tour.csc`:

```csharp
// tour.csc
// A quick tour of CScript's modern syntax and struct support.

struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32
}

// Pass struct by value
sum(p: Point) -> i32 {
    return p.x + p.y;
}

// Pass struct by pointer
move(p_ptr: Point*) -> void {
    (*p_ptr).x = (*p_ptr).x + 10;
}

main() -> i32 {
    // Instantiate with an aggregate literal.
    // The type is determined by the context.
    my_point: Point = { 5, 10 };
    
    initial_sum: i32 = sum(my_point); // Should be 15
    
    move(&my_point); // my_point is now {15, 10}
    
    // The final result should be 15 + 15 = 30
    return my_point.x + initial_sum;
}
```

### **Compile and Run**

```bash
# Compile the program (use .csc or .c, the compiler doesn't mind)
cargo run -- tour.csc -o tour_app

# Run the executable
./tour_app
echo $? # Should output 30
```

## üîß **Installation**

### **Build from Source**

1.  Ensure you have the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) and `clang` installed.
2.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/karesis/cscript.git
    cd cscript
    ```
3.  Build the release executable:
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```
    The executable will be located at `target/release/cscript`.

## üó∫Ô∏è **The Road Ahead**

Our journey is just beginning\! The next steps are focused on expanding the language's power and ecosystem.

  - [ ] **Arrays & Slices**: Implement first-class support for fixed-size arrays and potentially dynamic slices.
  - [ ] **Enums & Tuples**: Add more expressive data structures inspired by modern languages.
  - [ ] **C FFI (Foreign Function Interface)**: Leverage our C-compatible data model to allow seamless interoperability with existing C libraries.
  - [ ] **Module System**: Design and implement a simple file-based module system.
  - [ ] **Optimization**: Integrate more of LLVM's powerful optimization passes.
